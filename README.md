Java Scientific Calculator
This project is a Java-based scientific calculator that supports various arithmetic, geometric, and exponential operations. It provides functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh), and exponential operations (power, square root, quadratic, cubic, logarithm, natural logarithm, exponential function).

Features
1.Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers.
2.Trigonometric Functions: Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle in either degrees or radians.
3.Hyperbolic Functions: Calculate hyperbolic sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle.
4.Exponential Operations: Perform various exponential calculations including powers, square roots, quadratic and cubic equations,   
 logarithms, natural logarithms, and exponential functions.

Usage Notes
#When prompted, choose the desired angle mode (Degrees or Radians) before performing trigonometric or hyperbolic calculations.
#Input the required values as instructed and observe the calculated results.
